# permy
A cycle notation expression evaluator for permutation algebra. 

The first version of `permy` was made to expedite permutation algebra for problem sets in Harvard's Math 55a taught by Joe Harris (2023). It's scrappy, inefficient, and was written in 10m; but, it gets the job done. 

## Usage
1. First, clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arulandu/permy.git
```

2. Navigate into the root project folder
```bash
cd permy
```

3. Run `main.py` and use the permutation REPL loop!

```bash
python3 main.py
n: 100
$: (1 2 3)(1 2)
-> (1 3)
...
```

4. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to exit the REPL.
